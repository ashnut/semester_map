# Semester Map Prototype

A web application prototype for college students was created.

1. The student can plan their courses by dragging the subjects across various semesters and plan accordingly.

2. The student can view, if each subject has a pre-requisite or co-requisite just by hovering.

3. Each student can view the status of their subject and it is color coordinated using five conditions such as pass, fail, incomplete, withdrawn and in progress.

4.  A student can search for a course and can be enrol in the particular subject if he/she is eligible for it.

The system was designed using XAMPP stack. 
Frontend: HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript
Backend: PHP
Database: MariaDB

This was an initial draft of the project.
